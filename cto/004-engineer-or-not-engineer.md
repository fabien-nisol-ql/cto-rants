# 🛠️ You’re Not a Software Engineer Just Because You Write Code

We need to talk.

The title *“Software Engineer”* isn’t a job description. It’s a **responsibility** — one that’s earned through rigor, not assumed through job titles.

Anyone can write code.  
Only engineers **design systems that manage complexity, risk, and failure** over time.

## The Engineering Oath (Yes, There Is One)

Real engineers follow a simple but powerful principle:

> **“I will not knowingly build something that can fail dangerously.”**

This means:

- You design with **failure** in mind — not just features.
- You automate, test, and version — because people depend on your decisions.
- You care about **code health**, not just code output.
- You take ownership of your systems beyond the moment they "work".

## Code Is Easy. Engineering Isn’t.

Calling yourself an engineer means something.  
It means you’re willing to:

- Say *no* when the shortcut is unsafe  
- Say *wait* when the assumptions are wrong  
- Say *yes* to discipline even when no one is watching

If you want to call yourself a software engineer — **act like one**.

Otherwise, call it what it is: software technician, software developer, app builder — no shame in that. Just don’t wear the title if you haven’t accepted the oath.
