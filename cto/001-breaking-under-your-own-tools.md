## 🚧 From Engineering to Assembly: Why Modern Software Is Breaking Under Its Own Tools

Not long ago, software development was about **engineering**.

We designed systems. We modeled domains. We understood the trade-offs between abstraction and performance. We took pride in building resilient, well-structured codebases that could be maintained and understood.

But something changed.

Today, software development often feels like stacking duct-taped tools on top of each other just to make things “work.” We’ve gone from engineers to frantic assemblers — gluing together an ever-expanding constellation of YAML files, CLIs, container layers, secret managers, CI pipelines, and “dev experience” tools that require an *entire course* just to install.

Take **Tilt**, for example.

It's marketed as a solution for local Kubernetes development. And sure, it *does* solve a real pain point: live-reloading and managing microservices in a dev cluster. But using Tilt means understanding not just Kubernetes, but Helm, Docker, image registries, cluster networking, and writing custom `Tiltfile` scripts.

**That's not simplifying development — it's compounding complexity.**

### 🧱 Complexity Creep is Real

Every year brings a new tool that "fixes" the last tool’s problem. Skaffold. Kustomize. ArgoCD. Dagger. Tilt. Pulumi. Everyone's solving today's fire drill with tomorrow's fire.

What we’re building isn’t software — it’s *accidental complexity*. A mess of one-size-fits-none abstractions that break in subtle ways and require tribal knowledge to debug.

And it shows:

* Onboarding takes weeks.
* Dev environments drift.
* CI pipelines become fragile mazes.
* Debugging becomes archaeology.
* Senior devs spend most of their time just trying to *understand* the stack before changing anything.

---

### 🧠 Developers Are Trained to Forget the Black Box

Worse still, this complexity has trained a whole generation of developers to *forget about the black box*. Not because they want to — but because they have to.

The system is too deep, the layers too many, and the abstractions too opaque.

So we’ve created a culture where:

* Most devs know how to operate **at their layer**, but not beneath it.
* Teams always “need *the guy* who knows about layer 12 of the 24-layer stack.”
* Autonomy suffers. Curiosity fades. Confidence dies.
* Debugging turns into a scavenger hunt across Slack threads and Confluence docs last updated in 2019.

We’ve stopped building systems we understand. And when something breaks — nobody knows where to start.

This isn’t just inefficient. It’s **anti-engineering**.

### 👷‍🔧 The Toolbox Trap: When Experts Become Toolsmiths

If you're a full-stack, senior engineer — someone who actually understands the layers — you often become **"the person who makes the tools work."** Not because you want to. But because nobody else can.

You end up:

* Writing the CI/CD pipelines.
* Debugging Docker builds that no one else touches.
* Managing dev environment setups.
* Configuring Helm charts and fixing Kubernetes manifests.
* Explaining why some tool refuses to start for the fifth time today.

And suddenly, you're not writing **business logic** anymore. You're not shaping the product. You're not mentoring on architecture or performance. You're not applying your years of experience to deliver value to users.

You’ve been turned into the in-house DevOps plumber.

And the irony? The company thinks it’s getting "senior engineering" — but what it’s really getting is a full-time toolbox maintainer.

That’s a tragic misuse of expertise.

### 🤖 AI: The Next Accelerant of Complexity

Now enter AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, and others.

They make it even easier to generate complexity without understanding it. Want a Tiltfile? Done. A Helm chart? Sure. A Terraform module with ten resources? Why not?

But here's the danger:

* AI writes code without fully understanding your context.
* Developers copy-paste solutions they don’t actually grasp.
* Layers of glue accumulate silently — until one of them breaks.

AI doesn’t inherently cause chaos — but it **removes friction** from adding more layers you don’t understand. And once it stops working, you’re in deep trouble, because:

> Nobody knows how it was built.
> Nobody knows how to fix it.
> Nobody wants to touch it.

That’s how projects sink into the abyss.

### ✈️ The A380 Analogy: Real Engineering Takes Discipline

Think of something like the Airbus A380 — one of the most complex machines ever built. Thousands of people contribute to it: aeronautical engineers, hydraulics specialists, avionics technicians, software engineers, pilots, logistics planners, and more.

Of course, no one person knows every detail of the machine — and that’s fine. The difference is: **the aviation industry embraces this complexity with discipline**.

* Aircraft take **years to design and certify**.
* Every subsystem is **governed by procedures**, traceability, and documentation.
* Work is compartmentalized *intentionally*, but no part is treated as throwaway or “we’ll fix it later.”
* Changes go through simulation, modeling, validation, testing, and *real engineering rigor*.

Now look at software.

We’re trying to convince ourselves that we’re building A380-class systems — cloud-native, microservices, event-driven, devops-first, platform-engineered — with CI/CD pipelines, observability stacks, infrastructure as code, and AI copilots…

But the reality?

* We build it in weeks, not years.
* We stack tools fast and forget to understand them.
* We skip modeling. We skip testing. We merge and hope.
* We pretend it's okay not to know what’s under the hood.
* Developers are either stretched thin across too many layers or waiting passively for “someone else to fix it.”

This isn’t a sustainable path.

We say we’re building a digital world — but too often, we’re building a **tangled mess of abstractions held together with fragile glue**. And what’s worse: it’s what everything else now depends on.

### 🚨 The Result: A World on Shaky Software

Our modern infrastructure — banking, healthcare, transport, communication, energy — runs on stacks of software that:

* Must be updated daily,
* Break with every second dependency,
* Constantly change UI/UX with zero user feedback,
* Are increasingly frustrating, unreliable, and opaque to the users they're supposed to help.

We're not making people’s lives easier. We're making them reboot.

Instead of strong, modular, well-understood systems, we’ve built **a shaky scaffolding that wobbles every time someone deploys.**

This isn’t craftsmanship. This isn’t engineering.
This is reckless assembly at scale.

### 🔧 Getting Back to Basics

Somewhere along the way, we forgot about **Make**.

Yes — *Makefiles*. Simple, declarative, expressive tools to define **what to build and how**. They were predictable. Local. Easy to debug. You could *see* what was going on. You didn’t need a plugin system, a YAML parser, or an LLM to explain the output.

But now?

We’re using **Helm charts** and **Tiltfiles** — which are, when you look closely, just opinionated Makefiles with much more complex syntax, wrapped in YAML (a data language trying to express behavior). It’s overengineered indirection masquerading as progress.

What happened to understanding what we run?

What happened to tools that are *simple enough to trust*?

We didn’t need twenty layers of automation to ship reliable software before. We don’t need them now — unless we’re solving a problem that genuinely demands it. The rest is noise.

### 🤍 What Can We Do?

The good news? We’re not stuck in this mess. But it takes conscious effort to shift gears:

* **Resist unnecessary tools.** Simplicity scales. Don’t adopt tools just because they’re trending.
* **Think like an engineer.** Plan. Model. Write less, but better.
* **Design with constraints.** Avoid the infinite flexibility trap.
* **Reclaim your stack.** Understand every layer. Remove what’s not pulling its weight.
* **Use AI wisely.** Let it *augment* your understanding — not replace it. Always verify, always question, always refactor.
* **Protect your seniors.** Let them write business code. Let them coach. Don’t bury them under tooling glue.
* **Re-learn the fundamentals.** Use Make. Use Bash. Use tools that don’t lie to you.

### 💬 Final Thought

Software shouldn’t feel like a Rube Goldberg machine made of YAML and tears. It should be something we *understand* — something we can build, debug, and improve without having to memorize five CLIs and six config formats.

Engineering is about **clarity**, not **cleverness**. About **understanding**, not **automation-for-its-own-sake**.

Let your best engineers build value — not just toolboxes.

Let’s get back to the mindset that built great software with simple tools.

Let’s remember what it feels like to *know what we’re running*.
