## How Frontend Frameworks Made Debugging a Nightmare (And Why It's Not Your Fault)

For anyone who's ever spent 45 minutes trying to figure out why a session token isn't saving, why a log isn't showing up with the correct file name, or why your supposedly "simple" app has 9 layers of indirection just to render a button — this rant is for you.

### Let’s get one thing straight:

Modern frontend development is **not** simple. Not anymore. And certainly not in the context of production-grade applications.

Next.js, TypeScript, OpenID Connect, iron-session, App Router, Edge Functions, SWC, hydration, React Server Components, middleware headers, async cookies — all bundled together in what marketing likes to call “fullstack simplicity.”

Let me translate: **it’s a trap**.

### The Dream:

"With Next.js, you get the best of both worlds!"

* React on the frontend
* API routes on the backend
* Server Components
* Static and dynamic rendering
* And a unicorn in every `node_modules`

Sounds great, right?

Until you realize the following:

* You can't get the original `.ts` source file from a log stack trace — because Next.js only executes the **compiled** `.js`
* `Error().stack` in development still points to `.next/server/app/...` and gives you **zero** clue where in your actual code the error happened
* You **can’t fetch cookies** unless you call `await cookies()`
* You have to pass cookies **manually** when using `fetch()` on the server
* Your session mysteriously disappears because someone forgot to call `.save()` in a server route

And don't get me started on `NODE_ENV` not being respected in edge runtimes.

---

### So why is it like this?

Because the frontend ecosystem worships **developer experience for the first 10 minutes**, not the 10th month in production.

We sacrificed:

* Predictable behavior
* Simple, debuggable stacks
* Accurate logging
* Runtime traceability

For:

* "Hot reload"
* "Zero config"
* And the illusion of fullstack control

Meanwhile, the cost is passed to the poor souls trying to debug token refresh behavior across server boundaries that are **invisible** in the source code.

---

### The Real Villain? Acceptance.

The frontend community didn’t just get stuck with this. **They embraced it.**

They tweeted about it.
They turned 12-step CI pipelines into conference talks.
They normalized frameworks that break observability, then asked the backend team to figure out how to log user IDs again.

And now? Senior engineers are writing server-grade auth systems in environments that don’t even expose proper stack traces.

---

### What Should We Expect Instead?

* Logs that show us where code is executed, in our source files
* Errors that actually point to the bug, not some generated blob of `.next/compiled` trash
* Session handling that doesn’t require 4 helper functions and a prayer
* The ability to tell if you’re in client or server context without black magic

You know, the stuff we had in **Spring**, **Rails**, **ASP.NET**, **even MFC** — 15+ years ago.

---

### So Here’s the Bottom Line:

It’s not you.
You’re not dumb.
You’re not slow.
You’re navigating a maze that pretends it’s a straight path.

And unless we **push back** — unless we say "no, I want to know what file this log came from," and "no, I shouldn't have to rewrite half my auth flow just to get the cookies right" — this mess will keep getting worse.

Stop accepting duct-tape solutions.
Start demanding real engineering discipline again.

The stack won't mature unless we force it to.
