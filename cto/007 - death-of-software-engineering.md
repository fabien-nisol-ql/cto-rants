# The Death of Software Engineering: Why Society Prefers Throwaway Code

For decades, Java has been the backbone of serious computing. Banks, airlines, telecoms, hospitals—entire industries
rely on it because it is performant, scalable, and engineered for systems meant to last. It represents discipline,
structure, and a mindset of building software as infrastructure: something that should survive upgrades, migrations, and
years of use.

And yet, in 2025, we’re told it’s difficult to find Java developers. How is that possible when the language still
underpins so much of the world?

The answer is uncomfortable: real software engineering is in decline, replaced by a culture of disposable, DIY
programming. But perhaps another explanation exists too: Java might be following COBOL’s path—not dead, but so stable
that it requires only small groups of experts to keep it alive.

## 1. The Cult of Speed Over Durability

The mantra of modern tech is “time to market.” Build fast, pivot fast, fail fast. That mindset works for quick
experiments but has infected the entire industry.

Python, JavaScript, low-code frameworks: They let you get something working quickly—even if the result is slow, brittle,
or impossible to maintain.

Engineering rigor? Rarely rewarded. In fact, it’s often seen as a bottleneck.

This is why companies flock to “school languages”—easy to learn, easy to throw away.

## 2. From Craftsmanship to Assembly

Where engineers once designed systems to last, today’s developers are more often assemblers of pre-built parts: cloud
APIs, frameworks, AI wrappers. This reduces the need for foundational skills like concurrency, memory management,
distributed systems design—the very things languages like Java are exceptional at handling.

The result? A generation of “developers” who can ship something, but not engineer it.

## 3. The Rise of Disposable Software

When businesses don’t expect software to live more than a few years, why invest in maintainability? Why hire disciplined
engineers when you can flood a team with cheaper, fast-moving generalists?

This mindset mirrors a broader cultural collapse of durability:

We build houses that last 30 years, not centuries.

We buy electronics designed for replacement, not repair.

We favor immediate gratification over sustained value.

Software is just the latest casualty of this throwaway culture.

## 4. The Shrinking Pool of Real Engineers

Ironically, the places where reliability still matters—finance, healthcare, aviation, industrial control—are now
desperate for Java engineers. They compete for a shrinking talent pool because fewer people are willing to invest in the
discipline of true software engineering.

Universities churn out Python and JavaScript graduates. Bootcamps promise “job-ready” in 12 weeks. Meanwhile, the core
systems of civilization still run on Java and C++, and the expertise to maintain them is evaporating.

## 5. Or Maybe Java Is Just the Next COBOL

There’s another way to see it. COBOL didn’t die. It quietly kept banks, governments, and insurers running for half a
century. Today, estimates suggest hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL are still in production. Those systems don’t
need armies of developers—just small, expert teams to keep them humming.

Perhaps Java is entering the same phase: not obsolete, but mature.

Its systems are stable.

Its ecosystems are well-engineered.

They don’t require constant reinvention.

So the scarcity of Java developers may not signal decline. It may signal success: the software is so durable that it
doesn’t need constant maintenance by vast numbers of people.

## 6. The AI Contrast

At the same time, the world is racing headlong into AI—an area dominated by Python. To be clear, Python isn’t doing the
heavy lifting: frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch rely on C++ and CUDA under the hood. But orchestration, training
scripts, and glue code are almost all written in Python.

That means the world is coordinating its most complex, compute-heavy systems with a language known for fragility and
inefficiency. It’s another symptom of the cultural divide: discipline and longevity on one side (Java), convenience and
disposability on the other (Python).

## 7. What This Means for Society

The decline of software engineering isn’t just a tech problem—it’s a societal problem. When we no longer value
durability, precision, or long-term thinking, we erode the very foundations we depend on.

Throwaway code → Throwaway systems → Throwaway institutions.

What happens when the banks, grids, hospitals, and governments that rely on engineered software can no longer find
people to maintain it?

Or worse: when the next generation never learns how to engineer, only how to assemble?
